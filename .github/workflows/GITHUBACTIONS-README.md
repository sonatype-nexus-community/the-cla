GitHub Actions Notes
====================

Local Builds
---------------
You can locally test the GitHub Actions defined in this directory using [nektos act](https://github.com/nektos/act).

This allows you to run an equivalent CI build on your local machine. For example:
```console
    $ act
```
Note: The first time you run [act](https://github.com/nektos/act), it can take a long time (with no output) to download
the various docker goodies. Give it time before deciding it is stuck.

To get a list of available jobs, run:
```console
    $ act -l
```
To run a specific job, use the `-j` flag:
```console
    $ act -j <job-name>
```
For example, to run the `build` job from the `ci.yml` file, use this command:
```console
    $ act --workflows .github/workflows/ci.yml -j build
```
If running on Apple silicon, and you see docker errors, try launching act with this flag:
```console
   act --container-architecture linux/amd64
```
Without this flag, I saw this warning:
```console
WARN  ‚ö† You are using Apple M-series chip and you have not specified container architecture, you might encounter issues while running act. If so, try running it with '--container-architecture linux/amd64'. ‚ö†
```
and this error:
```console
